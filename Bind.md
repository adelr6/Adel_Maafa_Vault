# Bind

Bind is one of the most iconic maps in Valorant. Unlike many others, it has **no Mid area**, but it compensates with two unique teleporters that enable fast rotations and mind games. The entire gameplay of Bind is built around controlling choke points, using utility correctly, and predicting rotations.

## General Presentation

- Number of Sites: 2 (A & B)
- Special Feature: Teleporters
- Typical Playstyle: Tactical, control-heavy
- Good for: Controllers, Initiators, explosive Duelists

Bind forces teams to think strategically rather than relying only on raw aim. Rotations are fast, punishments are brutal, and bad decisions are costly.

## Key Areas of the Map

### **Site A**
- Open plant zones
- Requires strong smoke & vision control
- Good for Viper walls / Omen smokes

### **Site B**
- Tighter corridors
- Close-range fights
- Very good for shotguns and utilities like Raze grenades

### **Teleporters**
Two teleporters drastically shape Bind’s identity:
- A → B teleporter
- B → A teleporter

They allow instant repositioning but create noise, which adds psychological mind games and risks.

## Strategic Approach

### Attacking on Bind
- Use teleporters to fake and pressure defense
- Take early control of key choke points
- Play coordinated utility
- Force defenders to rotate badly

Recommended attackers:
- [[Raze]]
- [[Omen]]
- [[Viper]]

---

### Defending on Bind
- Hold angles patiently
- Use utility to delay instead of always fighting
- Listen to teleporters for information
- Don’t rotate too early

Very strong defenders:
- [[Killjoy]]
- [[Viper]]
- [[Omen]]

---

## Recommended Agents
Bind heavily favors agents who control space or create chaos:

- Controllers:
  - [[Viper]]
  - [[Omen]]

- Duelists:
  - [[Raze]]

- Sentinels:
  - [[Killjoy]]
  - [[Cypher]]
  
- Initiators: 
- [[Skye]]

 

These agents work great because they either slow down pushes, deny vision, or apply explosive pressure.
