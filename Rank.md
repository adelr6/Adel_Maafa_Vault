# Valorant Rank System

The Rank System in Valorant is designed to measure a player’s skill level, reward improvement, and provide balanced matchmaking in Competitive Mode. Each player receives a visible rank that changes depending on match performance and results.

---

## Rank Structure

Valorant ranks are divided into tiers from lowest to highest:

- Iron
    
- Bronze
    
- Silver
    
- Gold
    
- Platinum
    
- Diamond
    
- Ascendant
    
- Immortal
    
- Radiant (Top global players)
    

Each rank (except Radiant) contains **3 sub-tiers**, for example:

- Gold 1
    
- Gold 2
    
- Gold 3  
    → then next rank: Platinum 1
    

Radiant has no tiers because it represents the absolute top percentage of players.

## Rank Rating (RR)

Rank progression is tracked through **Rank Rating (RR)**.

- Winning a match → RR gains
    
- Losing a match → RR losses
    
- Good personal performance can slightly improve RR gains
    
- Very weak performance can slightly worsen RR losses
    

Rank thresholds:

- **100 RR → Rank Up**
    
- **Below 0 RR → Rank Down**
    

Match impact is more important than individual kills; winning is the most important factor.

## Placements & First Rank

Before receiving a visible rank:

- Players must complete placement matches
    
- The game evaluates:
    
    - Wins
        
    - Match impact
        
    - Performance consistency
        

Once placements are completed, the system assigns an appropriate starting rank.

Your rank stays hidden until all placement matches are finished.

---

## Rank Progression Philosophy

The ranked system is built around:

- Fair matchmaking
    
- Rewarding improvement
    
- Punishing repeated losses
    
- Highlighting truly skilled players at higher tiers
    

Radiant and Immortal exist to showcase elite players, while early tiers encourage learning and improvement.

---

## Party & Queuing Rules (Simple Overview)

- Players can queue solo or in groups
    
- Large rank gaps cannot queue together
    
- Higher ranks have stricter queue restrictions
    

This system protects competitive integrity and prevents rank manipulation.

---

## Competitive Integrity & Penalties

To maintain ranking fairness, Valorant enforces:

- AFK penalties
    
- Queue restrictions
    
- Match bans for repeated misconduct
    
- Vanguard anti-cheat enforcement
    

Players abusing the system risk losing RR or access to ranked.

## Why Ranks Matter

Ranks provide:

- A clear skill indicator
    
- Long-term motivation
    
- Competitive identity
    
- Goals to work toward
    

They are one of the most recognizable parts of the Valorant experience.
