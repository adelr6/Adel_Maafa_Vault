# Abyss


Abyss is a Valorant map characterized by **vertical gameplay and multiple chokepoints**. It has three main lanes and a central area that is key for map control. Gameplay on Abyss focuses on controlling vertical angles, using utility effectively, and coordinating rotations between sites.

---

## General Presentation

- Number of Sites: 2 (A & B)
- Special Feature: Verticality and tight corridors
- Typical Playstyle: Tactical, coordinated teamplay
- Good for: Controllers, Initiators, agile Duelists

Success on Abyss relies on teamwork and map awareness. Controlling the central area often determines which site can be safely attacked.

## Key Areas of the Map

### Site A
- Open plant zones with some vertical high ground
- Requires smoke and flash utility to block defender sightlines
- Effective for Omen smokes, Viper walls, and Jett mobility plays

### Site B
- Narrow entry points and confined spaces
- Defenders can hold strong angles with well-placed utility
- Good for Killjoy setups and close-range fights

### Mid / Central Area
- Connects both sites
- Control of Mid gives strategic advantage for rotations
- Aggressive pushers like Jett or Skye can take high-risk, high-reward plays
