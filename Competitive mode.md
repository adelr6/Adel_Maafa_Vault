# Competitive Mode

Competitive Mode is Valorant’s ranked game mode, designed to measure player skill, reward progression, and create a serious tactical gameplay environment.

## General Presentation

- Match Duration: ~30–45 minutes

## How a Match Works

- Players queue solo or in parties (up to 5 players)
    
- Teams start as Attackers or Defenders
    
- After 12 rounds, roles switch
    
- First to 13 total rounds wins the match
    

### Overtime

If the score reaches 12–12:

- Teams alternate sides (Attack / Defense)
    
- A team must win 2 rounds in a row to secure victory
    
- Players may vote for continued overtime or a draw after multiple OT cycles

## Rank Rating (RR)

Progress is tracked using **Rank Rating**: 

- Win a match → gain RR
    
- Lose a match → lose RR
    
- Strong individual performance can slightly improve RR gains
    
- Very poor performance may increase RR losses
    
Players are sorted by their skill level in a [[Rank]] , the objective is to get to the highest possible 
At **100 RR**, players rank up.  
Dropping below **0 RR** causes a rank down.

## Placement Matches

Before receiving a rank:

- Players complete placement matches
    
- The game evaluates performance and match results
    
- The initial rank is assigned once placements are finished
    

Your rank remains hidden until all placement matches are completed.

## Competitive Integrity

Competitive Mode enforces strict rules to keep matches fair:

- AFK penalties (away from keyboard, so not playing)
    
- Queue restrictions
    
- Behavioral monitoring
    
- Vanguard anti-cheat
    
- Ranked suspensions for misconduct
