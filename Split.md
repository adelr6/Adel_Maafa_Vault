# Split


Split is a popular Valorant map known for its **tight verticality and narrow choke points**. It has **three main lanes** and a central Mid area that is crucial for map control. Gameplay on Split revolves around controlling Mid, securing one site, and using utility to manage vertical angles and rotations.

## Key Areas of the Map

### **Site A**
- Wide open plant zones with high vertical angles
- Requires smoke and flash utility to block defender sightlines
- Good for Omen smokes / Viper walls / Jett mobility plays

### **Site B**
- Narrow entry points and tight corridors
- Easy for defenders to control if utility is used effectively
- Excellent for Killjoy setups and short-range fights

### **Mid**
- Central chokepoint connecting both sites
- Control of Mid gives strategic advantage for rotations
- Aggressive pushers like Jett or Skye can dominate this area
