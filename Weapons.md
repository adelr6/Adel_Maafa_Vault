Weapons (also known as Arsenal) are used by [[Agents]] to damage and kill/destroy enemy agents and their utility.

Overview
Agents can use many different variations of weapons, typically firearms, to cater to specific playstyles or metas. Weapons are separated into two main categories, Sidearms and Primary weapons. Sidearms consists of pistols, while primaries are further split into SMGs, shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, and machine guns.

Guns have limited amounts of ammo but come with 3 magazine's worth of that weapon's ammo as reserves. Bullets deal different amounts of damage depending on the gun, the body part they hit, and the distance between the shooter and the target.

## Mechanics

Guns are also affected by accuracy spreads. Most guns' first shot will have a spread value, meaning there is a possibility the shot fired will not make a perfect hit at the target under the player's crosshair. As well as spread values associated with firing the gun, accuracy penalties will be applied additively if the player is moving while shooting. The faster the movement, the higher the penalty added.

Weapons can be purchased by Agents using creds during the pre-round sequence. Each Agent is equipped with a Melee (knife) and the Classic sidearm for free by default. Agents will keep the weapons they purchase through each round until they die. Weapons can also be picked up off the ground after being dropped by a player, both friendly and hostile, which will carry on with the player into the next round. Players have to manage their team's economy as well as their own
