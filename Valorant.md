_**VALORANT**_ is a free-to-play first-person tactical shooter video game being developed and published by Riot Games 


It was announced on October 15, 2019 under the codename "Project A" (short for "Project Ares"), until it was officially revealed as _VALORANT_ on March 2, 2020. It was officially released on June 2nd, 2020 for PC.

By the time _VALORANT_ reached its first anniversary, the game had 14 million active monthly players and Riot announced the game would soon be coming to mobile platforms, with console platforms also being explored but not as high a priority. Of the two platforms however, it was console that arrived first with a limited beta starting on June 14, 2024.


_**VALORANT**_ is a competitive tactical shooter from the first-person perspective, featuring a cast of characters known as [[Agents]] that each have their own unique set of abilities to create tactical opportunities.

Ten players are divided into two teams, Attackers and Defenders, with the goal of winning the most rounds. In order to win a round, a team must eliminate the opposing team or complete their team-specific spike objective. First team who reaches 13 rounds, wins the game. The game starts in a lobby, where players have to lock in their Agent. The lobby lasts for 80 seconds or until everyone has locked in their Agent. Only one of each Agent can be selected on each team and players cannot see which Agent has been picked on the opposing team until the first Buy Phase. The Buy Phase occurs before each round and lasts for 30 seconds. During Buy Phase, most areas of the map are inaccessible and the two teams cannot meet each other. Therefore, Attackers cannot enter sites and are only limited to areas near their spawn zone, while the Defenders can move freely between sites, but not further than that. Players are also allowed to buy [[Weapons]] , shields, and abilities during this phase.

## [[Agents]]

Agents are composed of individuals with hypernatural abilities known as "Radiants" and radianite technology users. Each have their own Signature Ability and an Ultimate Ability used to create and allow tactical opportunities. Riot Games had stated they planned on launching _VALORANT_ with 12 agents and aim to release a new one every act, so long as that act doesn't contain other major content releases such as new [[Index]]

## [[Weapons]]

Players are able to utilize a range of different weapons, each with their own attributes to cater to specific playstyles, with corresponding strengths and weaknesses. Weapons can be bought during the Buy Phase using credits, bought for teammates or can be picked up when dropped by dead players. They are divided into the following categories: Sidearms, SMGs, Rifles, Shotguns, Machine Guns, Sniper Rifles and Melee.

## Abilities

Unlike Weapons, abilities persist after death and between rounds of the same half. Most [[Agents]]  have two Basic Abilities (although some may have one or three), charges of which is usually purchased between rounds but persist until used. They also have one Signature Ability (although some may have two) and one Ultimate Ability each. Signature Abilities are generally free and/or restock every round or every 2 kills. Ultimate Abilities can be utilized once upon acquiring 6 to 9 ultimate points depending on the agent which can be obtained by kills, spike plants, ultimate orbs, etc.
