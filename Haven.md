# Haven


Haven is a unique Valorant map with **three bomb sites (A, B, C)** instead of the usual two. This creates more strategic possibilities and forces attackers and defenders to make fast, informed decisions. Controlling the central Mid area is critical, as it connects all three sites and can determine the outcome of the round.

---

## General Presentation

- Number of Sites: 3 (A, B, C)
- Special Feature: Three bomb sites and open Mid
- Typical Playstyle: Tactical, coordinated teamplay, map-wide control
- Good for: Controllers, Initiators, supportive Sentinels, agile Duelists

Haven requires strong map awareness, communication, and strategic rotations. Teams that dominate Mid often have better opportunities to attack or defend any site.

## Key Areas of the Map

### Site A
- Wide plant zones with good long sightlines
- Effective for Viper walls and Omen smokes to block entry
- Best for controlling pushes from defenders

### Site B
- Central site with tight angles and chokepoints
- Ideal for utility-heavy defenders like Killjoy and Sage
- Useful for agents who can quickly rotate to other sites

### Site C
- Open spaces and high ground
- Great for Duelists like Jett to take aggressive fights
- Works well with controllers who can block vision

### Mid
- Central area connecting all three sites
- Controlling Mid gives strategic advantage and allows fast rotations
- Aggressive pushers can pressure defenders and force splits

## Strategic Approach

### Attacking on Haven
- Secure control of Mid early to open multiple options
- Use utility to force rotations and create site openings
- Attack in coordinated pairs or trios to avoid being picked off
- Use long-range control at A and C while pressuring B

Recommended attackers:
- [[Jett]] 
- [[Skye]] 
- [[Raze]] 

---

### Defending on Haven
- Rotate efficiently between three sites
- Use utility to delay attackers and gather information
- Control Mid to force attackers into predictable rotations
- Place traps, turrets, and Sage slows to slow pushes

Strong defenders:
- [[Killjoy]] 
- [[Sage]] 
- [[Omen]]

## Recommended Agents
Haven favors agents who can cover multiple areas, control Mid, or support the team across three sites:

- Controllers:
  - [[Brimstone]]
  - [[Omen]] 

- Duelists:
  - [[Jett]]
  - [[Raze]] 

- Sentinels:
  - [[Killjoy]] 
  - [[Sage]] 

- Initiators:
  - [[Sova]]

These agents are recommended because they allow control over multiple sites, create opportunities to split defenders, and maintain map-wide strategic advantage.
