## General features in Valorant maps

Most maps follow the same structure with:
- 2 main bomb sites (A & B)
- a central "Mid" area between the 2 objectives with strong strategic importance
- choke points
- long or short sightlines depending on the map 

Maps influence:
- agent selection like [[Harbor]] or [[Viper]] on larger maps)
- weapon choices (snipers on long sightlines, Shotguns in close combat)
- game's pace and meta strategies
