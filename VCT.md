# Valorant Champions Tour (VCT)

The Valorant Champions Tour (VCT) is Riot Games’ official professional competition circuit for Valorant. It is the international esports ecosystem where the best teams in the world compete across multiple seasons and tournaments to determine the world champion every year.

The goal of the VCT is to structure global competition, develop regional leagues, create international events, and crown an official Valorant World Champion.

## Rules of the games

Competitive ranked games, the rules of Valorant are designed to balance **fair matchmaking, individual skill progression, and casual competition**. Players are placed in matches according to their rank, and each match follows the standard game mode rules: best-of-25 rounds, two bomb sites (depending on the map), and the use of any unlocked agents. The focus is on personal improvement, climbing ranks, and experimenting with strategies.

In VCT (Valorant Champions Tour) matches, the rules are **strictly professional and standardized** to ensure fairness and a spectator-friendly experience. Matches often follow **best-of-three or best-of-five formats**, with clearly defined map pools, official agent bans or restrictions, and structured side-switching rules. Tournament organizers enforce **timeouts, coach interactions, and technical rules**, and players must adhere to strict conduct standards. Additionally, VCT matches feature **professional broadcasts with observers, commentators, and analyst desks**, creating a highly structured environment compared to casual ranked play.

The key difference is that **ranked games prioritize skill development and matchmaking balance**, while **VCT matches emphasize team strategy, professionalism, and consistent competition under official regulations**
